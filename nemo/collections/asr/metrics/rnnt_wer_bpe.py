class RNNTBPEDecoding(AbstractRNNTDecoding):
    """
    Used for performing RNN-T auto-regressive decoding of the Decoder+Joint network given the encoder state.

    Args:
        decoding_cfg: A dict-like object which contains the following key-value pairs.
            strategy: str value which represents the type of decoding that can occur.
                Possible values are :
                -   greedy, greedy_batch (for greedy decoding).
                -   beam, tsd, alsd (for beam search decoding).

            compute_hypothesis_token_set: A bool flag, which determines whether to compute a list of decoded
                tokens as well as the decoded string. Default is False in order to avoid double decoding
                unless required.

            preserve_alignments: Bool flag which preserves the history of logprobs generated during
                decoding (sample / batched). When set to true, the Hypothesis will contain
                the non-null value for `alignments` in it. Here, `alignments` is a List of List of
                Tuple(Tensor (of length V + 1), Tensor(scalar, label after argmax)).

                In order to obtain this hypothesis, please utilize `rnnt_decoder_predictions_tensor` function
                with the `return_hypotheses` flag set to True.

                The length of the list corresponds to the Acoustic Length (T).
                Each value in the list (Ti) is a torch.Tensor (U), representing 1 or more targets from a vocabulary.
                U is the number of target tokens for the current timestep Ti.

            compute_timestamps: A bool flag, which determines whether to compute the character/subword, or
                word based timestamp mapping the output log-probabilities to discrete intervals of timestamps.
                The timestamps will be available in the returned Hypothesis.timestep as a dictionary.

            rnnt_timestamp_type: A str value, which represents the types of timestamps that should be calculated.
                Can take the following values - "char" for character/subword time stamps, "word" for word level
                time stamps and "all" (default), for both character level and word level time stamps.

            word_seperator: Str token representing the seperator between words.

            The config may further contain the following sub-dictionaries:
            "greedy":
                max_symbols: int, describing the maximum number of target tokens to decode per
                    timestep during greedy decoding. Setting to larger values allows longer sentences
                    to be decoded, at the cost of increased execution time.

            "beam":
                beam_size: int, defining the beam size for beam search. Must be >= 1.
                    If beam_size == 1, will perform cached greedy search. This might be slightly different
                    results compared to the greedy search above.

                score_norm: optional bool, whether to normalize the returned beam score in the hypotheses.
                    Set to True by default.

                return_best_hypothesis: optional bool, whether to return just the best hypothesis or all of the
                    hypotheses after beam search has concluded.

                tsd_max_sym_exp: optional int, determines number of symmetric expansions of the target symbols
                    per timestep of the acoustic model. Larger values will allow longer sentences to be decoded,
                    at increased cost to execution time.

                alsd_max_target_len: optional int or float, determines the potential maximum target sequence length.
                    If an integer is provided, it can decode sequences of that particular maximum length.
                    If a float is provided, it can decode sequences of int(alsd_max_target_len * seq_len),
                    where seq_len is the length of the acoustic model output (T).

                    NOTE:
                        If a float is provided, it can be greater than 1!
                        By default, a float of 2.0 is used so that a target sequence can be at most twice
                        as long as the acoustic model output length T.

                                maes_num_steps: Number of adaptive steps to take. From the paper, 2 steps is generally sufficient,
                    and can be reduced to 1 to improve decoding speed while sacrificing some accuracy. int > 0.

                maes_prefix_alpha: Maximum prefix length in prefix search. Must be an integer, and is advised to keep this as 1
                    in order to reduce expensive beam search cost later. int >= 0.

                maes_expansion_beta: Maximum number of prefix expansions allowed, in addition to the beam size.
                    Effectively, the number of hypothesis = beam_size + maes_expansion_beta. Must be an int >= 0,
                    and affects the speed of inference since large values will perform large beam search in the next step.

                maes_expansion_gamma: Float pruning threshold used in the prune-by-value step when computing the expansions.
                    The default (2.3) is selected from the paper. It performs a comparison (max_log_prob - gamma <= log_prob[v])
                    where v is all vocabulary indices in the Vocab set and max_log_prob is the "most" likely token to be
                    predicted. Gamma therefore provides a margin of additional tokens which can be potential candidates for
                    expansion apart from the "most likely" candidate.
                    Lower values will reduce the number of expansions (by increasing pruning-by-value, thereby improving speed
                    but hurting accuracy). Higher values will increase the number of expansions (by reducing pruning-by-value,
                    thereby reducing speed but potentially improving accuracy). This is a hyper parameter to be experimentally
                    tuned on a validation set.

                softmax_temperature: Scales the logits of the joint prior to computing log_softmax.
